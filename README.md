# Lat Lon

I often hardcode locations/centers/etc, which takes far too many clicks to get the coordinates. No more!

On another note, did you know the [ArcGIS JS API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) can natively handle other [spatial references](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/core-concepts/spatial-references/) outside WGS84 with Lat/Lons? It's [pretty cool](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/layers-csv-projection/index.html) (and compiled to Wasm!).
